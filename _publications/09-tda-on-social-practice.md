title: "A Topological Analysis of Communication Channels for Knowledge Sharing in Contemporary GitHub Projects"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019/05/09-tda-on-social-practice
excerpt: 'In this research, our goal is to analyze how communication channels share knowledge over projects. First, using the SECI model, we are able to map how knowledge is transferred through the communication channels. Then in a large-scale topology analysis of seven library package platforms, we extracted insights of how knowledge is shared by different library ecosystems within GitHub.'
