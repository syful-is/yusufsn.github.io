The story
======

Over 10 years ago, while living in Salatiga, Indonesia, I began teaching in the Universitas Muhammadiyah Surakarta. Since 2009, I have teaching several courses, including Data Mining, Logics and Set, Software Engineering, Web Programming, and Programming Algorithm. Little did I know it would change my life.

While teaching as my primary task, learning valuable skills on doing research and giving community services gave me the opportunity to land better work, which led to better compensation and more flexibility in my day-to-day. More than that, working on research and publications make me as an expert in the field and this can enhance my reputation as a teacher too in the eyes of my colleagues and my students. 

Still, learning it all was a struggle. Where do I learn? What do I learn? I knew there were others out there, feeling the way I did.
